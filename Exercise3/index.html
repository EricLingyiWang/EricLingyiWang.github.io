        <p>This is a typical concerto containing three movements, the first and third movements are fast and the second movement is slow.
        He wrote it while he was depressed and undergoing hypnotherapy. He dedicated his work to his therapist.
        The concerto is written in C minor. It is quite popular as some movies and pop music borrow parts of its contents.
